# Nois Airdrop

This is a non interactive version of the randdrop.
It fetches the randomness first so that you know in advance who are the winners and who are not.

Cons:
Once the randomnness is there people can just extract a list and publish it with all the winners. so no there is no gamified experience
Pro:
You know in advance how many tokens will be won by splitting the addresses in the snapshots into groups.
