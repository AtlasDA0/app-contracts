# P2P NFT Lending

**Borrower's Overview**

The process begins by posting a listing on the platform. Whether you want your loan request visible to all or exclusively to specified addresses, the choice is yours. To secure the loan, you must provide NFTs that will be held in an escrow contract as collateral. In your listing, state the desired capital and the loan duration. Peer lenders can then make offers or propose modifications to your preferred terms.

Upon accepting an offer in the form of Stars, The stars will go in your wallet. Simultaneously, your NFT is moved into an escrow smart contract for the agreed loan period. Successfully repaying the loan before its expiration results in the return of your NFT. Defaulting, however, allows the lender to foreclose and take possession of your NFT.&#x20;

**Lender's Overview**

Lenders, on the other hand, have the opportunity to peruse various NFT collections on Stargaze, like Bad Kids, Pixel Wizard, and more. They can extend loans against the NFTs listed by borrowers as collateral. In return, lenders earn an agreed-upon Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the loaned amount. When the borrower repays the loan, the capital, plus the agreed fee, is returned to the lender. In cases of default, the NFT collateral is automatically transferred to the lender, akin to acquiring the NFTs at a substantial discount. This open the door for another way to gain exposure to an NFT you like and earn some yield at the same time. If the borrower doesn't pay, you get to keep the NFT at a discounted price and can sell it in the open market for a significant profit.

**Loan Repayment Process**

As a borrower, fulfilling the repayment of the loan, including interest, unlocks the release of your NFT from the smart contract's escrow, returning it directly to your wallet. Failure to make full payment by the due date empowers the lender to foreclose, moving the NFT from escrow to their wallet.

Early repayment is possible at any time, though a portion of the interest will still apply. Repayment must be made from the wallet originally used to initiate the loan. Once a loan defaults, repayment is no longer an option, even if foreclosure has not occurred. After a lender forecloses a defaulted loan, they become the exclusive owner, and repayment through the platform is no longer possible.
